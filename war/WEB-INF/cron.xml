Uploading cron jobs

You can use AppCfg to upload cron jobs. When you upload your application to App Engine using AppCfg update, 
the Cron Service is updated with the contents of cron.xml. You can update just the cron configuration without 
uploading the rest of the application using AppCfg update_cron.

To delete all cron jobs, change the cron.xml file to just contain:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cronentries/>

Cron support in the Admin Console

The Admin Console allows you to view the state of your cron jobs. Select the "Cron Jobs" link from 
the side menu to view the state of the jobs, including the last time the job was run and the result of the job.

You can also see when cron jobs are added or removed by selecting the "Admin Logs" page from the Admin Console menu.

Cron support in the development server

The development server doesn't automatically run your cron jobs. You can use your local desktop's cron or 
scheduled tasks interface to trigger the URLs of your jobs with curl or a similar tool.
